# OQL Reference for Instance Tree Analysis

## Feature Overview

- Implement navigation from the found instances in OQL results to a detailed tree view of their Reachables or Referrers in ProfileHeapDumpOql.vue.
- I would like implement a cool feature that will show Reachables or Referrers of the given found
  instances in a tree structure.
- The tree structure will allow to expand/collapse nodes to explore the object graph.
- Each node in the tree will represent an object instance, displaying its class name and unique identifier
- The tree will be interactive, allowing users to click on nodes to view more details about the instance,
  such as its fields and values.
- If I click to the instance in the tree, it will show all the fields of the instance with their values.
- The tree will also support filtering and searching, enabling users to quickly locate specific instances
  or classes within the tree.
- clear labeling of relationships (e.g., "refers to", "referred by"). intuitive navigation controls to explore the tree structure.
- the tree should be optimized for performance to handle large object graphs without significant lag.
- The tree should be generated by already parser Heap object of the NetBeans Parser 

## Design Considerations

- Use consistent and modern and clear visual indicators for expandable/collapsible nodes.
- Ensure that the tree structure accurately represents the relationships between instances.
- Use consistent styling and compact layout to maximize readability.
- Consider lazy loading of tree nodes to improve performance for large datasets (if it's actually needed).

Use ultrathink to find great well looked way and wel-functioned implementation of this feature.
